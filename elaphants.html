         <h3>ELAPHANTS</h3>
        <P>Elaphants are large mammals of the family elapantidae and the order proboscidea. Two 
            traditionally recognised, the African elaphat (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elaphas maximus) 
            are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male Africa elaphants are the
        extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</P>
                    <p>All elaphants have several distrinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk
                        proboscis, used for many purposes, particulary breathing , lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors
                        tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elaphants' large ear flaps help
                        to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elaphants have
                        large and concave backs while Asian elaphants have smaller ears and convex or backs.</p>
                
                          <p>Elaphants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savanna 
                            forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                          <p>You will find the elaphants at pen E22, right next to the amphithearter</p>
